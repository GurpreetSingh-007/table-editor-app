# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

This project currently has no source files or documentation. To be immediately productive, follow these guidelines:

## Project State
- The workspace is empty. No code, configuration, or documentation files are present.
- No build, test, or workflow scripts are available.

## Getting Started
- If you are initializing the project, create a README.md describing the intended architecture, major components, and developer workflows.
- Establish conventions for directory structure, naming, and code organization as you add files.
- Document any new build, test, or integration commands in README.md and update this file as the project evolves.

## Updating This File
- As the codebase grows, update this file to reflect:
  - Major architectural decisions and rationale
  - Key developer workflows and commands
  - Project-specific conventions and patterns
  - Integration points and dependencies
- Reference important files and directories as examples.

## Example Next Steps
- Add a README.md with project goals and initial setup instructions.
- Create initial source files and document their purpose.
- Define and document build/test/debug workflows as they are established.

**Update this file regularly to keep AI agents productive and aligned with project practices.**
